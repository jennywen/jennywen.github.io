          <div class="font-regular">Role</div>
          I worked as Hack the North's primary user experience designer for most of 2015. I championed the design of the hackathon's website, and iOS application, and also dug into the front-end codebase to implement style changes.

          <div class="font-regular">Design Audit</div>
          In its second year, and as a part of onboarding myself onto the Hack the North team, I decided to perform an audit of all of the hackathon's existing design assets. I shared the design audit with the team in order to align on high-level goals and overall design direction before I got started on any specific tasks.

          <div class="font-regular">Rebranding</div>
          As part of the design audit, I proposed the idea of branding the hackathon with a unique theme.  It evolved with time, but eventually it came to encompass the previous brand colours so it could be recognizable, and also brought an outdoors-y analogy to the typical hackathon.

        <div class="portfolio-page-text-container portfolio-page-description">
          I was inspired by the boy scouts badges, and the way that hackers adorned hackathon stickers on their laptops the same way a boy scout would&ndash;as tokens of accomplishments. I collected some outdoors-y illustrations and badges as inspiration for the concept.

          <div class="font-regular">Goal</div>
          We needed to provide a robust way for eager hackers to apply for the hackathon and check the status of their application. It was projected that over 5,000 hackers were to apply, while there were only 1,000 spots to be offered. It was definitely a requirement that we be transparent and cogent about the entire process.

        <div class="portfolio-page-text-container portfolio-page-description">
          <div class="font-regular">User stories</div>
          We  had conversations with hackers and hackathon volunteers&ndash;both new ones and old, and they gave us some insight as to how they saw the process of applying to hackathons. From that we devised a set of user stories that we could reference in order to ensure that the end product would meet their needs.

        <div class="portfolio-page-text-container portfolio-page-description">
          Using our user stories, I led this exercise with the development team one afternoon, so we could all understand what needed to be built, and we all understood the reasons we were building what we were building. We summarized our findings  in a map of all the different paths someone might take, so we could make sure that we were comprehensive in our design.

          <div class="font-regular">Hacker applications</div>
          Inspired by how digestible, and mobile-friendly broken down forms were, we decided to  break down the experience question-by-question, while still providing navigation to quickly switch between questions.

        <div class="portfolio-page-text-container portfolio-page-description">
          We chose this kind of flow because it made a normally intimidating process feel bite-sized and manageable. It also worked really well on mobile, which isn't super conducive to long forms.

        <div class="portfolio-page-text-container portfolio-page-description">
          <div class="font-regular">Next time</div>
          Crunched for time and resources, I focused almost exclusively on the actual application form since it was what was essential. I think we definitely could have done a better job being more transparent with applicants as to their status in the application process and what their next steps with us were.

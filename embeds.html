          <p>Each of these projects spanned a month or so, but I think of them as a part of a longer arc of Paper’s story. I worked with a PM, a writer, and a few engineers for all of these projects, but I drove the direction—the scope, the strategy, the execution—on most of them.</p>

            <p>On one hand, modern documentation requires more than just words. On the other, there are also way too many different tools involved in the creative process. The work gets fragmented. One of Paper’s overall goals was to become the tool that united all of the other tools.

              <div class="lh-copy f5 mt3 mb4">
                <p>While the success metric of teach of these efforts was different from project to project, a recurring high-level metric was the number of users who’d ever embedded anything into a Paper doc.
</p>
                <p>People who’d used embeds were much more likely to become active users, since they were a key part in discovering the magic of Paper—transforming a blank canvas into interactive, creative documentation. The minimalism that people loved of Paper, however, was a double-edged sword in making features more discoverable within the product.

              <div class="lh-copy f5 mt3">
                <p>One of my first projects on Paper was to make the insert menu more discoverable. We aimed to make Paper easier to use, but also to increase the likelihood that people would discover our rich embeds.</p>
                <p>
                  With the new toolbar, we saw 27% increase in % of doc viewers clicked on an item in the toolbar. We also saw a 2% increase in percentage of doc viewers who added non-text content, particularly more table and list inserts.

          <div class="serif f2 fw6 lh-solid">Dropbox file embeds</div>
          <p>To bridge the gap between Dropbox’s file sharing service and Paper, we created a rich way to add Dropbox files to any doc. We gave users a way to import Dropbox files and then adjust the size of them so they looked polished at any arrangement in a Paper doc.</p>

        <div class="serif f2 fw6 lh-solid">Drag and drop anything</div>
        <p>People frequently attempted to drag files into a Paper doc and just expected it to work. We didn’t, however, support it.</p>
        <p>We created a nearly invisible experience where dragging in a file just worked. Behind the scenes it was complex. In most cases, dragging in a file would upload it to your Dropbox account and show the file embedded in the doc.</p>
        <p>If the file was already stored in your Dropbox, however, we’d check for a match in your Dropbox and link those. This way, we weren’t needlessly hogging your Dropbox space. In some cases, we wouldn’t be able to verify if there was a true match in your Dropbox, so we created a flow for you to manually verify the match.</p>

        <div class="serif f2 fw6 lh-solid">Generic unfurl embeds</div>
        <p>While we supported certain types of embeds based on deliberate partnerships with those companies, those only made up a small percentage of all the types of content people could put in their Paper docs.</p>
        <p>To help people realize that Paper could be more than a text editor, earlier, we created a generic embed that would appear when any URL was unfurled.</p>
        <p>When accounted for as an embed type, we saw generic unfurls increase the number of embeds by 100%. The results showed us that there was value in embeds, but we just previously didn’t offer embeds of very many of the links people were adding.

        <div class="serif f2 fw6 lh-solid">In-product education</div>
        <p>Bundled with our introduction of generic embeds, we wanted to educate our users about the different types of embeds we offered. By only showing this in-product education once a user has pasted their first link into Paper, we targeted high intent users. We used it as a celebratory moment to unveil all the other things they could do with Paper.</p>
        <p>The release of the feature resulted in a 6% increase in users who embedded content in Paper docs.</p>

        <div class="serif f2 fw6 lh-solid">Embeds were useful, but only when people discovered them</div>
        <p>While most of these efforts aimed to make embedding more discoverable and valuable, people just weren’t doing it as often as we’d hoped they would. The nature of Paper’s interface was a double-edged sword. It was minimal and only sort of revealed its functionality in a just-in-time manner, when you needed it. At the same time, not being presented with these options upfront made people dismiss the tool as just a “note-taking app”.

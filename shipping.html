          <p>During my stint at Shopify, I worked as a designer, embedded on the Shipping team with a handful of engineers, some PM folks, and another designer. Building an ecommerce platform, the Shipping team at Shopify was responsible for making sure the merchants on our platform could ship their products to their customers.</p>

              <p>As a team, our mandate was simple: do whatever we can as a company to make it easier for merchants to get their products to their end customers. We were doing that by reducing the reliance on third-party applications for our merchants' shipping needs. We'd started by selling shipping labels on our platform, but over time, we'd liked to absorb as much of that process into Shopify as possible—from organizing shipments, all the way to packing boxes.</p>

              <p>To make sure that whatever we were building mades sense for us as a team, a business, and a product, our team relied on the success of these metrics:</p>
              <p>Number of merchants using, and revenue ($) from Shopify shipping: moving merchants to our in-house shipping solution</p>
              <p>Support hours spent helping merchants: minimizing these hours due to the complicated configuration of shipping settings and logistics</p>

            <div class="lh-copy f5 mt3 mb4">
              <p>Although the shipping problem was wide and encapsulating of a complicated process, I wanted to improve and simplify the way that merchants organized their geographically-based shipping costs. I mapped out the existing workflow, and it looked something like this:</p>

      <section class="w-two-thirds fr lh-copy">
        <p>We'd gotten some feedback from new merchants that they weren't too clear on how a shipping zone and shipping rate were related based on the back-and-forth of this flow, so we thought to simplify the flow by embedding shipping rates within a shipping zone.</p>

        <p>It seemed to work well, and more people understood the relationship between shipping rates and shipping zones. However, as we began to explore it on mobile web, we found that the responsive shrink-and-stack strategy we were using for mobile web made this section complicated to use on mobile.</p>

      <p>
      Based on the faults of our existing mobile-web strategy, we started exploring ways in which we might have designed Shipping settings if it were optimized for an experience on mobile web. I built a prototype using a layered approach to explore a way in which we could break up each section of the settings, and each form field into a separate screen.

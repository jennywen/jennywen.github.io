            As a side project, I worked on Votepad with my partner-in-crime, <a href="//joeyloi.com">Joey Loi</a>. I pushed most of the pixels, and we worked together on the ideation and research processes. Promoting voter turnout was a social issue we were both very passionate about.

          Voters do not feel that they are empowered with the necessary information which would enable them to make informed voting decisions. In the 2011 Canadian election, fewer than 40% of eligible voters under 24 voted.

          <p>
            Plenty of nationwide studies exist regarding voter turnout, so we pulled on those to assess areas of concern, and reasons why people weren't voting.
            Some of our findings included:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Voters reported a high barrier to obtaining actionable information
              </li>
              <li>
                People often do not vote because the process is intimidating
              </li>
              <li>
                The age demographic for lowest voter turnout was between ages 18-24
              </li>
            </ul>

          Based on our research of voter demographics and people who might have a hard time voting, we created three personas. The bases of the personas were real people we had met or spoken to about the issue.

          <p>
            In Canada, there were existing websites and such that involved completing a quiz, and then being assigned to an appropriate political party based on the quiz results, sort of Ã  la Seventeen Magazine's "What kind of flirt are you?". To us, the experience felt opaque, and the matching algorithm unclear. Studies had found some of these tools, including CBC's Vote Compass to be Liberal-biased.
          </p>
          <p>
            We opted for a paradigm that keeps the decision-making in the hands of the voter, where voters choose stances on issues, and then the party they align with based on their stances. We realized that the weight, or the importance of an issue to isn't represented  by just counting the number of issues that a voter agrees on with a certain party.

            We saw Votepad really as an integral part of a Canadian's civic life, so we wanted to make sure that it worked with their stories. We used our personas, and weaved Votepad into the stories of their lives in order to fill in gaps of our flows and fine-tune our features so that they would make sense for the people we were building for.
          </p>
          <p>
            From this exercise, we realized that we should have placed a larger emphasis on educating and instructing a first-time voter, or someone who hasn't voted for a while, on how to vote in the Canadian system.

          We eventually chose to contain items within cards because they helped to visually contain each issue, and we could use entire cards as tap targets, since our thumbs can certainly be a little finnicky at times.        </div>

          We experimented with checkboxes to emulate the experience of voting, and selecting a candidate, so a first-time voter could get comfortable with the paradigm of checking off their favorable choices in a list.

          Our first iteration left some people confused as to what the intended action was&ndash;it wasn't blatantly obvious that we wanted you to tap the empty checkbox! So we worked on a circular button that actually looked more similar to the circle that appears on Canadian voting cards, and is also more tap-target friendly.        </div>

          <div class="portfolio-page-section-header">Should voting be more social?</div>
          The 2015 Canadian election saw a resurgence in voting amongst low votership demographics like the 18-24 age range, largely due to a political party that was unfavourable to young people, and guerrila social media tactics surrounding strategic voting. Although Votepad encourages political discussions by allowing voters to share their stances, I think it'd be worth exploring how it could evolve to blur the lines between the discussions taking place on other social media networks, and someone's experience on our app.

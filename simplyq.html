        <div class="portfolio-page-description"> 
          <div class="font-regular">Role</div>During my internship at rokk3rlabs, I worked as the primary front-end developer on a project for a client called SimplyQ. There were two other designers on the two who had worked on the branding and design before I was onboarded onto the project.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-page-description">
          SimplyQ was a multimedia lifestyle journal for young, professional females in the Miami area, with a specific focus on Latin culture.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-page-description">
          <div class="font-regular">Splash Page</div>The goal was to patch together a quick page which would act as a placeholder for the actual website. With this assignment, I was constrained by the copy and specifications of the client. Ideally, I wanted to make the page simple, actionable, and something that really allowed users to understand the product and what it could provide for them.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-page-description">
          <div class="font-regular">admin panel</div>The goal here was to design an experience for editors and bloggers to post and customize content.
        </div>
        <div class="row portfolio-page-description">
          Overall, with this project, I wish I could have been more involved in defining the product itself, as opposed to filling in some of the gaps of the design itself. I really loved the idea of the product and the brand which the client chose to emanate, but I think there were lapses between the flow of the admin panel and the user-facing section of the site.

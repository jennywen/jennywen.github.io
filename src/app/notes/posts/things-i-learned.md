Like a gratitude journal, I love reflecting on the things I've learned. It shows that as humans, we're capable of progress. It's one of the most hopeful feelings I get.

Here's a list of things I found in my personal notes from 2020. A year where we felt particularly hopeless...

- It's important to tell myself nice things about myself
- How to cope (sort of?) with insomnia              
- How to roast a trout
- How to unclog a dishwasher
- How to depend on and share a life with someone else   
- More about the history of San Francisco (link to)
- How to work remotely? Sort of?
- It's important to "thrive, not just survive" during a pandemic
- It's okay to (sometimes) interrupt someone in a Zoom call
- To feel more comfortable in my job
- What it's like to have a Coronavirus pod and have The Hard Conversations with friends that (sometimes) hurt each others' feelings
- America's history with capital punishment, the death penalty, etc.
- More about the housing crises across America
- To love San Francisco
- How to cut Joey's hair like Cillian Murphy's in Inception
- How to ride my bike up big hills
- How to be a normal person who cooks 90% of their own meals
- That taking photos of people I care about is a thing I care about
- My feelings have names!
- I can and should be more compassionate to myself
- My fears and anxieties are a lot of what's stopping me from doing more / better, not just my skills and abilities
- More about the automatic, unhelpful thoughts I have
- You can be "romantic" about friendships. You probably should be!
- I have a limit to alone time. Social activities give me energy when it's with people I care with and we're all present.
- Lots more on building high-fidelity prototypes
- A little bit more peace about not having "productive" hobbies
- Building a 0 to 1 product
- How to run an interview loop
- More on how to compromise in a relationship, as opposed to just fighting tooth and nail for what I want
- How to be a (little bit more) comfortable with gaining weight throughout the pandemic
- That I say "um" and "like" way too much in public settings!
- All the names of counties of cities in America (thanks John King!)
- It's okay to make decisions people don't agree with

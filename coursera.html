          <div class="font-regular">Role</div>I led this project at Coursera, and worked as the primary designer and developer on it before I ended my internship. I also worked with a product manager, and my mentor to develop the business requirements and the engineering specifications for fleshing it out.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-page-description">
          <div class="font-regular">Context </div>The motivation for this design was to increase the value of the Verified Certificate and provide a personal space dedicated to learners on Coursera to view their accomplishments, and share them with their employers and peers. The design was validated through A/B testing and user testing with design walkthroughs.

                <li>"Coursera offers credentials I can share with others in ways I wouldn't with a traditional education"</li>

          <div class="font-regular">Existing Solution</div>Prior to the redesign, learners had the capability of sharing their course completions, but many learners were not aware that they were able to do this. The following diagram shows the flow of the pages in existence, and how they were accessed. Views labeled "shareable" notes that these custom pages could be viewed by anyone with the URL.<img src="assets/img/portfolio/courserecord_flow.png" class="img-block portfolio-page-img">
          <p>Here's an original task analysis of the decided flow of sharing a course completion with someone else, say and employer (current or potential): </p><img src="assets/img/portfolio/courserecord_hta.png" class="img-block portfolio-page-img">
          <p>Based on the task analysis, we found it possible to simplify the flow into four views - combining the Course Record and Verification pages, as shown in the below diagram:</p><img src="assets/img/portfolio/accomplishments_flow.png" class="img-block portfolio-page-img">

        <div class="portfolio-page-description">
          <div class="font-regular">User Testing</div>With a high-fidelity mockup inVision mockup, we performed user testing through UserTesting.com with five participants, as well as two participants internally to gauge directional feedback and pain points in the design. Here's what we found:
          <ul> 
            <li>Participants referred to the page colloquially as their "Profile", suggesting that it would be worth exploring the expansion of this page to be a social profile</li>
            <li>Participants intuitively clicked on certificate thumbnails to find what they were looking for, as opposed to text links</li>
            <li>They emphasized the value of LinkedIn sharing in their verbal feedback</li>
            <li>Participants found that the section that stated "Other Completed Courses" lacked detail in comparison to their Verified Certificate courses</li>
            <li>There was confusion around the number of shareable URLs and where they were placed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>From prior A/B tests that we ran across the site's paid products, we also found that learners were motivated by the idea of linking their identity to their learning, which influenced the voice behind some of the copy in the Accomplishments page.</p>

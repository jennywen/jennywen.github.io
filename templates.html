                <p>Our goal was to create a differentiated feature that would make Paper appealing, activate people and their teams, and ultimately retain them in the long-term. Metrics that measured how valuable the feature would be were:</p>

            <p>We'd be using the same back-end editor as regular Paper docs but we opted for a darker header bar because we'd been using that pattern on one of our other products, Showcase, and it provided the most contrast to editing a doc.</p>
            <p>We started out by using adding the template library to all of the existing surfaces where we'd enable doc creation.</p>

        <p>Engineers were able to build a quick and scrappy version of this without the bells and whistles of UI polish. We released it internally to let people play with it.</p>
        <p>While we originally weren't sure where the best entry points were for the template library, we received a bunch of internal feedback that adding it in the doc header made creation of docs feel slow and disrupted people's workflows.</p>
        <p>We were originally skeptical that people would want to create docs from templates directly from folders, but the data we pulled found that doc creation from folders was the third most popular place to create docs from.</p>
        <p>We also conducted 10 interviews with people who had use cases for templates, to understand how templates could fit into their workflows, as well as to get usability feedback on our early build. Places where our assumptions broke down were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Templates themselves weren't collaborativeâ€”usually one person made them and shared them with their team to use</li>
          <li>The "plus" icon was confusing</li>
          <li>People didn't associate "blank doc" as a template</li>
        </ul>

        We knew that the feature set that we released with was limited, so we reached out to people who had tried out the feature to learn about how they were using it.

                <p>While we envisioned Paper as a collaborative tool for work, there were clear limitations to the product:</p>

                  <li>It was impossible to create in-house templates that match every conceivable team's processes</li>
                  <li>Workarounds to copy and paste were a compromise for users who didn't feel like Paper is a tool that works for the way they work</li>
                  <li>Teams struggled to have consistent processes across projects which hindered their abilities to be efficient and effective</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We also saw adoption of Paper to hinge on initial adopters', or "Champions'" abilities to prove how the tool could be used on their teams.</p>

                <p>As a product, Paper's high-level metric was activation of users on teams, which we knew was related to how collaborative people were and the number of differentiated features someone tried out. Therefore, our goal was to create a differentiated feature that would make Paper appealing, activate people and their teams, and ultimately retain them in the long-term.</p>

              <div class="lh-copy f5 mt3">
                <p>Although the shipping problem was wide and encapsulating of a complicated process, I wanted to improve and simplify the way that merchants organized their geographically-based shipping costs. I mapped out the existing workflow, and it looked something like this:</p>

      <section class="w-two-thirds fl lh-copy">
        <p>We'd gotten some feedback from new merchants that they weren't too clear on how a shipping zone and shipping rate were related based on the back-and-forth of this flow, so we thought to simplify the flow by embedding shipping rates within a shipping zone.</p>

          <p>It seemed to work well, and more people understood the relationship between shipping rates and shipping zones. However, as we began to explore it on mobile web, we found that the responsive shrink-and-stack strategy we were using for mobile web made this section complicated to use on mobile.</p>

          <p>
          Based on the faults of our existing mobile-web strategy, we started exploring ways in which we might have designed Shipping settings if it were optimized for an experience on mobile web. I built a prototype using a layered approach to explore a way in which we could break up each section of the settings, and each form field into a separate screen.

        <section class="w-two-thirds fl lh-copy">
        <p>Heuristically, the number of layers felt overwhelming to someone who might have gone in wanting to adjust just one shipping rate. So, we aggregated related form fields into sections, and created a pattern of having read-only settings, where only constructive and destructive actions were placed in a separate layer.</p>

        <p>To bring the exploration back full-circle, we proposed that the corresponding desktop system would follow the same sheet transitions to provide a consistent experience.</p>

        <p>Since the Shipping section of our platform's settings were amongst the more complicated, we proposed similar patterns for the existing sections of our settings, and using similar constructive and destructive sheets for other parts of our platform like creating and editing products or customer profiles.</p>
